# Welcome to Reactjs Quest05
***

## Task
In this quest, we are building a multi-page application using React Router. There are two exercises:
### ex00 - Simple Routing
- Create a ReactJS project.
- Install `react-router-dom`.
- Create an application with 3 pages: Home, About, and Users.
- Set up routing to navigate between these pages.
### ex01 - Nested Routing
- Create a ReactJS project.
- Install `react-router-dom`.
- Create an application with nested routes under the Topics page.
- Topics page includes two nested routes: Components and Props v. State.

## Description
ex00 - Simple Routing
The challenge in this exercise is to set up basic routing in a React application. We used the `react-router-dom` library to define routes and navigation links.
ex01 - Nested Routing
The challenge in this exercise is to implement nested routing in a React application. 
We extended the previous setup to include nested routes under the Topics page, making use of React Router's `Routes` and `Route` components to handle nested paths.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   cd ex00 or ex01
2. Install dependencies:
    npm install

## Usage
 - Run the application with `npm start`. Use the navigation links to move between different pages and observe the URL changes reflecting the current page.
