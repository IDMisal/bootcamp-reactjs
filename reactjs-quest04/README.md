# Welcome to Reactjs Quest04
***

## Task
Problem:
The goal is to create two ReactJS components, one stateful and one stateless, to understand and practice the differences between them. The stateful component will manage its own state, while the stateless component will render data passed to it via props.

Challenge:
- For the stateful component: correctly manage and display internal state.
- For the stateless component: correctly receive and display data via props.

## Description
Solution:

Stateful Component (MyLocation):
- A React class component that manages its own state.
- It has a location state variable initialized to 'local state'.
- It displays a message incorporating this state.

Stateless Component (List):
- A functional component that receives title and list as props.
- It renders a title and a list of items.
