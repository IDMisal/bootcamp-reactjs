# Welcome to Reactjs Quest02
***

## Task
The task involves creating and editing ReactJS components as part of a series of exercises. 
Each exercise requires creating a new ReactJS application, modifying the default components, and creating new components, both inline and in separate files. 
The challenge lies in understanding the structure of a ReactJS application and how to effectively create and manage components.

## Description
The problem is solved by following a series of steps to create and edit ReactJS applications:
1. Creating a ReactJS Application: Using npx create-react-app to set up a new React application.
2. Editing Components: Modifying the App.js file to change the default content and structure.
3. Creating New Components: Implementing new components either directly within App.js or in separate files, and then importing and using these components within the application.
4. Styling Components: Adjusting the CSS to meet the required styling criteria.
5. Port Configuration: Changing the default port in package.json to avoid conflicts with other applications.

## Installation
To install the project, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to each exercise directory:
    cd ex00
    cd ex01
    cd ex02
2. Install the necessary dependencies using npm:
    npm install

## Usage
To run the ReactJS application for each exercise, use the following command:
    npm start
This will start the development server on port 8080, as specified in the package.json file. 
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 to see the application in action.
