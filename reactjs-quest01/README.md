# Welcome to Reactjs Quest01
***

## Task
The task is to set up a ReactJS project and make specific changes to the default setup for each exercise. 
The challenge is to configure the development environment correctly and implement the specified modifications.


## Description
For each exercise, the following steps were taken:
1. **Exercise 00: Setup React Project**
   - Created a React project using `create-react-app`.
   - Changed the default development server port to 8080 by modifying `package.json`.
   - Ensured `node_modules` is ignored by Git using `.gitignore`.
2. **Exercise 01: Add A Class**
   - Modified the default React component to replace the message with "My First ReactJS App" inside a `div` with the class "title".
   - Removed the default "Learn React" link.
3. **Exercise 02: Update CSS**
   - Modified the default React component to replace the message with "Greeeeen!" inside a `div` with the class "title".
   - Removed the default "Learn React" link.
   - Updated the CSS to change the background color to `#66CC00`.

## Installation
To install and set up the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone <repository-url>
2. Navigate to the project directory for each exercise:
    cd ex00
3. Install the dependencies:
    npm install
4. Repeat the steps for each exercise directory (ex00, ex01, ex02).
## Usage
To start the development server and see the application in action, use the following commands for each exercise:
1. Navigate to the project directory:
cd ex00
Start the development server:
    npm start
2. Open your web browser and go to:
